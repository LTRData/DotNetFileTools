VhdBlockBackup

Disk image block based backup tool, version 1.0
Copyright (c) Olof Lagerkvist, LTR Data, 2023-2025

This backup tool uses lists of block checksums for virtual machine disk image
files. A block checksum list file (called metafile) created at source location
is compared to corresponding file and target location to calculate amount of
data that differs since last backup. That data is then transferred to a
differencing image file with target image file as parent.

Syntax
------

VhdBlockBackup --createmeta file1.vhdx [file2.vhdx ...]
    Creates metadata file with block checksums. This is first step to prepare
    for backup operations. With this operation, file names can contain
    wildcards.

VhdBlockBackup --check source.vhdx target.vhdx
    Displays information about how much data would be copied with a --copy
    operation. Also checks that meta data indicate compatible image file
    sizes.

VhdBlockBackup --copy [--createmeta] [--diffdir=directory] source.vhdx target.vhdx
    Copies modified blocks from source.vhdx file to a new target_diff.vhdx.
    The new diff image file will be created with target.vhdx as parent so that
    modifications can be easily merged into target.vhdx later.

    Note that meta block lists must already be present and up to date when
    running --copy. If combined with --createmeta, source image block list
    does not need to already exist. Instead, it will be created and blocks
    detected to be different from target image will be copied during the
    process. This could save time, particularly for images with large amounts
    of changes.

    Directory specified with --diffdir can be a separate directory where
    target_diff.vhdx will be created.

Prepare for first backup
------------------------

Consider a source disk image file C:\VM\disk0.vhdx that is backed up to a
remote \\remote\c$\VM\disk0.vhdx. To prepare for this, first create meta files
both on source and target servers:
VhdBlockBackup --createmeta C:\VM\disk0.vhdx
This creates C:\VM\disk0.vhdx.blocklist.bin that will be used later.

On source server, to check how much data will be copied to target location:
VhdBlockBackup --check C:\VM\disk0.vhdx \\remote\c$\VM\disk0.vhdx

You can then copy changes like this:
VhdBlockBackup --copy C:\VM\disk0.vhdx \\remote\c$\VM\disk0.vhdx
This will not modify \\remote\c$\VM\disk0.vhdx. Instead, it creates a new
differencing image file \\remote\c$\VM\disk0_diff.vhdx with original
\\remote\c$\VM\disk0.vhdx as parent. The differencing image file could then
be merged into its parent on remote server, or left like this to allow both
original and new state of the image file to be preserved. If you merge it,
remember to also move \\remote\c$\VM\disk0_diff.vhdx.blocklist.bin to replace
\\remote\c$\VM\disk0.vhdx.blocklist.bin so that correct state of remote image
is known to next backup run.

With slow connections between source and target servers, this could take a lot
of time and it is then recommended to use --diffdir switch to specify a
temporary location of the differencing image file. The differencing image file
could then be manually transferred to remote location in some other way.
VhdBlockBackup --copy --diffdir=C:\backuptmp C:\VM\disk0.vhdx \\remote\c$\VM\disk0.vhdx
This creates the differencing image file at C:\backuptmp\disk0_diff.vhdx
instead of \\remote\c$\VM\disk0_diff.vhdx.

Next backup
-----------

For next backup, you need to create a new C:\VM\disk0.vhdx.blocklist.bin at
source server, and make sure that corresponding file at remote location is in
sync with actual data in the image file at remote location. For example, at
source server:
VhdBlockBackup --createmeta C:\VM\disk0.vhdx

At remote server, merge old backup into parent image and move meta file to
reflect this:
Merge-VHD C:\VM\disk0_diff.vhdx
move /y C:\VM\disk0_diff.vhdx.blocklist.bin C:\VM\disk0.vhdx.blocklist.bin
